# x2f-etl

I needed to convert a Xenforo forum over to Flarum... and most of the forum-specific
ETL tools out there are either buggy or can't handle the customization baked into
this ancient Xenforo instance that I'm working with. So, don't expect pretty
code, or code that will necessarily work in your own environment.

I am not associated with either Xenforo or Flarum, and am not an expert on either.
